\usage{
evalplot.envSim.hist(
  e = NULL,
  occs.z = NULL,
  bg.z = NULL,
  occs.grp = NULL,
  bg.grp = NULL,
  ref.data = "occs",
  sim.type = "mess",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{ENMevaluation object}

\item{occs.z}{data frame: longitude, latitude, and environmental predictor variable values for occurrence records, in that order (optional);
the first two columns must be named "longitude" and "latitude"}

\item{bg.z}{data frame: longitude, latitude, and environmental predictor variable values for background records, in that order (optional);
the first two columns must be named "longitude" and "latitude"}

\item{occs.grp}{numeric vector: partition groups for occurrence records (optional)}

\item{bg.grp}{numeric vector: partition groups for background records (optional)}

\item{ref.data}{character: the reference to calculate MESS based on occurrences ("occs") or background ("bg"), with default "occs"}

\item{sim.type}{character: either "mess" for Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface, "most_diff" for most different variable,
or "most_sim" for most similar variable; uses similarity function from package rmaxent}

\item{categoricals}{character vector: names of categorical variables in input RasterStack or data frames to be removed from the analysis;
these must be specified as this function was intended for use with continuous data only}

\item{envs.vars}{character vector: names of a predictor variable to plot similarities for; if left NULL, calculations are done
with respect to all variables (optional)}

\item{occs.testing.z}{data frame: longitude, latitude, and environmental predictor variable values for fully withheld testing records, 
in that order; this is for use only with the "testing" partition option when an ENMevaluation object is not input (optional)}

\item{hist.bins}{numeric: number of histogram bins for histogram plots; default is 30}

\item{return.tbl}{boolean: if TRUE, return the data frames of similarity values used to make the ggplot instead of the plot itself}

\item{quiet}{boolean: if TRUE, silence all function messages (but not errors)}
}
\value{
A ggplot of MESS calculations for data partitions.
}
\description{
Plots environmental similarity of reference partitions (occurrences or background) 
to remaining background (all other partitions). This function does not use raster data, and thus
only calculates similarity values for data used in model training. Further, this function does
not calculate similarity for categorical variables.
}
\details{
When fully withheld testing groups are used, make sure to input either an ENMevaluation 
object or the argument occs.testing.z. In the resulting plot, partition 1 refers to the training data,
while partition 2 refers to the fully withheld testing group.

There are two variations for this plot. If "histogram", histograms are plotted showing the MESS estimates for each partition group. 
If "raster", rasters are plotted showing the geographical MESS estimates for each partition group. 
With sim.type option "mess", the similarity between environmental values associated with the 
validation occurrences (per partition group) and those associated with the entire study extent (specified by the extent 
of the input RasterStack "envs") are calculated, and the minimum similarity per grid is returned. 
Higher negative values indicate greater environmental difference between the validation occurrences
and the study extent, and higher positive values indicate greater similarity. This function uses the `similarity()` function 
to calculate the similarities. See the below reference for details on MESS.
